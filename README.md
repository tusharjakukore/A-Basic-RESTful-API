# A-Basic-RESTful-API
A task of building a simple RESTful API using Node.js that manages a collection of tasks (e.g., to-do items). The API should allow users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks

Step 1: Set Up Your Project 

    Create a new directory Clone repo.
   
        
Step 2: Install dependencies 

    Run  npm install 
    Run  npm install express body-parser
  
Step 3: Start the Server

    Run node app.js to start the server.

Step 4: Test API

    Test API Using Postman at  http://localhost:3000/tasks



    for POST and PUT method use following JSON Format
    {
    "title": "Complete Report",
    "description": "Write a detailed report on the project progress."
    }

The simple RESTful API for managing tasks should now be up and running. We can test the API using tools like Postman or by sending HTTP requests from your frontend application.
