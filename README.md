# A-Basic-RESTful-API
A task of building a simple RESTful API using Node.js that manages a collection of tasks (e.g., to-do items). The API should allow users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks

Step 1: Set Up Your Project 

    Create a new directory Clone repo.
    Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
    Initialize a new Node.js project by running npm init -y.
    Install necessary dependencies:
        npm install express body-parser
        
Step 2: Install dependencies 
Run command npm install 
Run command npm install express body-parser

    Create a file named  app.js in your project directory.
    Require the necessary modules:

    javascript

const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
nitialize Express:

javascript

Step 3: Start the Server

    Run node app.js to start the server.

Step 4: Test API

    Test API USing Postman at  http://localhost:3000/tasks

The simple RESTful API for managing tasks should now be up and running. We can test the API using tools like Postman or by sending HTTP requests from your frontend application.
